PROJECT SUMMARY:

This project aims to develop a Machine Learning-based system that recommends the most suitable crop and fertilizers for a given set of soil and environmental conditions.
By analyzing key parameters like soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall, the system uses trained ML models to provide accurate and personalized agricultural suggestions. 
The solution promotes sustainable farming by reducing resource wastage, improving crop yield, and enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions through an easy-to-use interface.
